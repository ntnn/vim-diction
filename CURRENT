Version: 2

Rewrite. Doesn't use `diction` anymore.
Using a similar database format (tsv) is simpler than parsing the output
of diction and also enables vim-diction to ship with multiple databases
by default.

New Commands:
    * DictionLog

New Options:
    * diction_formatter
    * diction_databases

To Dos:
    * Allow ranges to pass those through to
    * Command to add to existing qf/loclist

Removed:
    * diction_options
    * diction_suggest
