To Dos:
    * Allow ranges to pass those through to diction via stdin.
      In that case an offset has to be given to calculate_lnumcol
    * Allow different / multiple files
    * For some reason the calculated lnum/col are a few characters
      off, sometimes positive, sometimes negative
    * Better way to remove leading and trailing whitespace
    * Tokenize instead of magic numbers
