From dictions man page:

`diction` finds all sentences in a document that contain phrases  from
a database  of  frequently  misused,  bad  or  wordy diction.

This small plugin wraps diction and parses the output to display it in
the quickfix or location list.

For more information read the documentation `:h diction.txt`.
